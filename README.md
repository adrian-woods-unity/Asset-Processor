# Asset-Processor
Package for filtering and processing all assets in Unity

The filtering section will filter any assets in either the scenes or the asset database and produce the results of that filter
Filtering can be done on asset types like Materials and Textures, or on any property of any component of any game object (including custom implemented MonoBehaviours)
Once filtering is complete, scripted methods that function on that type will be available for processing either all or the selected assets in the results section
